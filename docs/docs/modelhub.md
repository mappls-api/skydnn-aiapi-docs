## Inverse Perspective Map

Obtain bird's eye view of a scene from a single input image

![inverse-perspective-mapping](/docs/images/inverse-perspective-mapping.png)

## Signage Detection

Signage detection is essential components in the intelligent vision based transportation system by which in-vehicle is able to recognize the traffic signage in various shapes and interpret the contents such as speed limit, stop, and yield.
